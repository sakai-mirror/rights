# Most strings used in the LicenseDialog template come from two places:
#
#   1) the license definitions contained in /sakai-rights-impl/src/rdf/licenses
#   2) the file named questions.xml in /sakai-rights-impl/src/rdf/questions
#
# Those files are loaded into Content Hosting at startup.  Changes or new verstions 
# can be supplied by making changes through the Resources tool after startup.  But
# generally changes to those files should be make through the Creative Commons  
# organization's processes rather than by changing them within Sakai.
#
# The strings in this file are specific to Sakai.
